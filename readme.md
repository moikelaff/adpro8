1. What is amqp?

    amqp is a protocol for message-oriented middleware. It is used to send messages between different applications or services in a reliable and efficient manner. in this case, i am using amqp to connect to rabbitmq via the crosstownbus library

2. What does it mean? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first guest, and what
is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?

    first guest is the username to connect to rabbitmq, and the second one is the password. localhost:5672 is the address of the rabbitmq server.
